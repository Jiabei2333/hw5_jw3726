## Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(rvest)
library(purrr)
set.seed(1)
file_names =list.files(path = "./data") 
path = str_c("./data/", file_names)
total_table = tibble(x = file_names) %>% 
  mutate(output = map(path, read_csv) ) %>%
unnest() %>%
janitor::clean_names()%>% 
separate(x, into = c("arm", "subject"), sep = "_") %>%
  separate(subject, into = c("subject", "delete")) %>%
select(-delete)%>%
gather(key = week_of_study, value = Value, week_1:week_8) %>%
separate(week_of_study, into = c("a", "week"), sep = "_")%>%
  select(-a) %>%
janitor::clean_names() 
group_by(subject, arm)
##make a spaghetti plot
ggplot(total_table, aes(x = week, y = value, group = (arm:subject), color = subject)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
